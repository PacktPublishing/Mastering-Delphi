After that, you'll delve into web development with Intraweb and uniGUI. Finally, we'll integrate with cloud services and interact with IoT.
Towards the end, you will learn to integrate your app with various web services and deploy them. By the end of the video, you will be able to build powerful, cross-platform, native apps for Windows and Android with a single code base. You will also have enormous experience with Full Stack Development.
